### Description:

The NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Metorolgical Laboratory conducts the long-term monitoring as part of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) to track the status and trends of coral reef ecosystems of the US Atlantic and Caribbean Reef jurisdictions. This summer brief provides an overview of the most recent survey efforts.

* The most recent climate monitoring trip took place at St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands from September 4th to September 9th 2022.

* Data were collected at 4 different transects oriented in cardinal directions around the island (16 sites) to collect and deploy instruments that monitor temperature, current, pH, light, bioerosion and calcification.

* Our focus site in Salt River Bay managed by the National Park Service, additional work was completed. This includes landscape mosaics(n=6) and carbonate budget surveys(n=6)to monitor changes in benthic cover and carbonate production.
